      My kids leave for school at all hours in the morning so my goal is to make
      them something quick and healthy! Smoothies are the ultimate way to jam
      pack as much nutrition as possible into one drink. These 6 Superfood
      Smoothies are the perfect meal and are full of vitamins that will keep
      them energized and their minds sharp. The key is the smoothies must taste
      amazing or my kids won’t drink them! I sneak in handfuls of spinach
      without them even detecting it since it has such a mild flavor yet is such
      a nutritional powerhouse. Since smoothies are full of fresh fruits,
      vegetables, and protein — the options are endless. We mix it up with lots
      of variety so the smoothies don’t get boring. I am posting our fabulous
      six superfood smoothies which are filled with superfoods that will start
      your mornings off right.
